    <h1>Travel Guide</h1>
    <h6>
                Man is a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a place for a long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever they find time and opportunity. People travel for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also travel for business and employment. Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we go to a new place all of our senses and instincts (বােধশক্তি) become awake (জাগ্রত). In such circumstances, we can learn new things very easily. Everything seems beautiful and sterling in a new place. With new scientific inventions, the ways and means of traveling have changed dramatically. Now different types of vehicles are available to us.
